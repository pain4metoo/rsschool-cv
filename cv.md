### About me

At the moment I am raising my English level to B2. In the future, I want to study node js
and next js in order to become a useful specialist in the company where I will work. I am
able to solve tasks independently, I find information very well. A positive and sociable
person. I ask a lot of questions :)
You will find more information about me on my website or on github

### Code example

      let category = state.category;
      let length = state.data[category].length;
      let randomCount: number = Math.floor(Math.random() * length);

      if (state.previousAnswers[category].includes(randomCount)) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= length; i++) {
          if (!state.previousAnswers[category].includes(i)) {
            randomCount = i;
            break;
          }
        }
      }

### Experience

##### The beginning of self-study of the very basics of Front-end development.

- HTML/CSS/SASS was studied by the method of layout of landing pages, multi-page sites.
  I created a slider in pure css and various animations. Studied the semantics and
  methodology of BEM. I learned how to write proper HTML and CSS. I studied SASS, which
  simplifies CSS writing.
  [Example](https://pain4metoo.github.io/myProjects/museum/)
- I studied JavaScript, solving problems on CodeWars 4-8 kyu, created interactive
  elements on the site page, such as (slider, video player, forms, pop-ups). I used JS to
  interact with DOM elements. I made an analogue of the Momentum application on pure JS.
  I learned how to work with asynchronous functions and APIs.
  [Example](https://pain4metoo.github.io/myProjects/momentum/)
- Git/Npm All my projects are on github, I studied how to use git correctly in practice when
  developing my projects. Npm has been studied in practice when installing various libraries.
- React/Redux/TypeScript was learned by creating a favorite SPA project "English quiz". In
  this project, I applied all the knowledge I had previously gained in HTML, CSS, SASS, JS,
  TS. Asynchronous functions, pop-ups, interactive user interaction. Storing data in local
  storage and the like. In parallel, he mastered writing pure
